# Python_Projects
Using Python for creating .csv and pattern generation library 

This python module at first query the mongoDB collection for retreving the headders of a given collection i.e mnemonics to be exact.
This is followed by generating a csv file in which the headers are mapped to the memonics field values in a column wise manner.
The redundent files aere generated, which are erased after the computation is over, This can be solved by keeping the data in memoery but as we deal with data as large as 3000 rows in a single column it may not able to keep it memory resulting to overflow or lack of memory error. 

The final output of this python project is to geretare csv files that are requied by the following project "Project-DART-JAVA" which is the parent directory of this git profile.
